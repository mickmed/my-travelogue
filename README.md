   Scaled is a recipe calculator that allows users to calculate a ```nutrition facts``` label based on given ingredients. Natural language processing is available, for e.g., '1/2 cup strawberries.' The app uses the free tier of the nutritionix API. Unfortunately this limits calls to 200/day, including undefined returns but is sufficient to showcase the functionality. Also users can save recipes that when retrieved do not make an api call.
