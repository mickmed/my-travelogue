## &#9992; My Travelogue

   My Travelogue is a travel diary. Users click on the map and the name of the city and country autopopulate the form using the opencagedata geolocation API. The pins are saved on the map and when clicked the data can be retreived. Users can also add pics, as well as update and delete their entries.
